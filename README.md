# Pollen Buddy

A small and experimental Java Wunderground Pollen PHP library.

## What it do:

Gets you four date pollen prediction in the United States using the Wunderground API using simply your zipcode.

## This library gives you:

TBD

## More Info You Don't Care About

Currently there are no existing APIs on the web that gets live pollen data with predictions. This gets you that.

This is a rewrite of a similar Java library I wrote last year for my Pollen Buddy app. 

## Note

You can use this anywhere the MIT license permits.

Please kindly credit me, however, when you use this library, and if possible, contribute back patches when/if necessary.

Do not, I repeat, do **NOT** use this library in a live production settings!

It uses [some TBD PHP scraping library] to scrape HTML/DOM directly off of Wunderground's Pollen site, and Wunderground could tweak their HTML/CSS just a bit, and it would break this library. I am not responsible for you losing millions of dollars.

*Actually that would be pretty cool.*
